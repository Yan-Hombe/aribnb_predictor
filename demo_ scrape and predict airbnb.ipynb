    "This Jupyter notebook guides you through the process of downloading Airbnb data and using the data to make some predictions. The data we will be using is sourced from the Inside Airbnb project and can be accessed at the following URL: [Inside Airbnb Data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). In addition you can use the file to make some longitude and latitude requests on the google API.\n",

    "The functions needed to scrape and process the data, as well as make predictions, are all stored in the Python file \"scrape_and_predict_functions.py\". This notebook makes use of all the functions from this file, but depending on your specific requirements, you may choose to use only certain parts. To ensure proper functioning, please ensure that the \"scrape_and_predict_functions.py\" file is in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
